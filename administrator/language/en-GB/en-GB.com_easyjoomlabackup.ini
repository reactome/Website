COM_EASYJOOMLABACKUP_MAXIMUMEXECUTIONLEVEL="Initial Execution Level"
COM_EASYJOOMLABACKUP_MAXIMUMEXECUTIONLEVEL_DESC="How many levels should be used for the initial scanning preparation values. The default value in the free version is 6 levels.

To improve performance you can reduce the number!<br /><br /><strong>This option can only be changed in the Pro version!<strong>"
COM_EASYJOOMLABACKUP_MAXIMUMEXECUTIONTIME="Maximum Execution Time"
COM_EASYJOOMLABACKUP_MAXIMUMEXECUTIONTIME_DESC="Maximum execution time in seconds per batch process. The value should be adjusted if the backup process runs into a timeout. The default value in the free version is 10 seconds. The value 0 means that the script uses the half of the maximum execution time provided by the server. If you set a custom value, then the system value is overwritten. If you encounter an error, then decrease the selected value step-by-step to find the best setting.<br />Actual execution time is entered value in seconds + processing time of currently archived folder!<br /><br /><strong>This option can only be changed in the Pro version!<strong>"

A comment helps you to find the correct backup if you have a problem and want to go back to an exact state of the website.<br /><br />This component uses the PHP ZipArchive module (php_zip). If this module is not installed, then the component can not create a backup.  Please contact your hosting company if the module is deactivated!<br /><br />If you have a large website, then the creation of the backup archive can take several minutes! Please do not close the window or click anywhere when the backup process is running.<br /><br />The database backup is very important. If you don't change the files on the server, then you should only backup your database. A full backup should always be created before updates of the core or extensions, at least once a week.<br /><br />How to restore the backup? If you want to restore the backup, then you have to upload the files to your server and import the SQL dump into your database (e.g. with the help of phpMyAdmin). If you want to restore the backup on another server, then you have to add the new data into the configuration.php manually.</p><p class="pro-tip"><strong>Pro Tip</strong> You can restore the backup created by Easy Joomla Backup Pro with one click directly on the server using the standalone script <a href="_QQ_"https://kubik-rubik.de/downloads/ejb-easy-joomla-backup/restore-joomla-3-pro"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"Easy Joomla Backup Restore"_QQ_">Easy Joomla Backup Restore</a>!
